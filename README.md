# EmmaBot
Best bot in the world.

Many new features will follow soon. This bot version is like an alpha alpha version.


Infos about the AddRole/RemoveRole Command:
-> This command only works with roles lower in the hierarchy(ServerSettings->Roles) than that of the bot. So no worry someone gets an Administrator role by accident.


Credits to different programmers I got inspired by:
-zekro#9131(membercount in Gamestatus, addrole Command)
-Vale#5252(LMGTFY command)
