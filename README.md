# EmmaBot
Best bot in the world.

Many new features will follow soon. This bot version is like an alpha alpha version.


Infos about the AddRole/RemoveRole Command:
-> This command only works with roles positioned lower in the hierarchy(ServerSettings->Roles) than the bots role. So no worries about someone getting admin rights by accident. And of course the bot needs the permission to do this.


Credits to different programmers I got inspired by:\
-zekro#9131(addrole Command)\
-Vale#5252(LMGTFY command)
